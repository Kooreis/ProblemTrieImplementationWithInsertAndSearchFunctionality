# Question: How would you implement a Trie (prefix tree) with insert and search functionality? C# Summary

The provided C# code implements a Trie (prefix tree) data structure with insert and search functionalities. The TrieNode class represents a node in the Trie, containing a dictionary of its child nodes and a boolean flag indicating whether it is the end of a word. The Trie class contains a root TrieNode and methods for inserting and searching words. The Insert method iterates over each character in the word, checking if a child node for that character exists in the current node's children dictionary. If it doesn't, a new TrieNode is created and added to the dictionary. The current node is then updated to the child node for the current character. Once all characters have been processed, the EndOfWord flag of the current node is set to true, indicating the end of a word. The Search method works similarly, iterating over each character in the word and checking if a child node for that character exists. If it doesn't, the method returns false, indicating the word is not in the Trie. If all characters are found, the method returns whether the current node's EndOfWord flag is true, indicating whether the word as a whole is in the Trie. The Main method demonstrates the usage of the Trie, inserting and searching for various words.

# Python Differences

Both the C# and Python versions solve the problem in a similar way, by creating a Trie data structure and implementing insert and search methods. However, there are some differences due to the language features and methods used.

1. Class Definition: In both languages, classes are used to define the Trie and TrieNode. However, Python does not require explicit access modifiers (like public in C#) or type declarations.

2. Dictionary Usage: Both versions use a dictionary to store the children of each node. In C#, the ContainsKey method is used to check if a character is already a child of the current node. In Python, the get method is used, which returns None if the key is not found.

3. Null/None Checking: In C#, the null keyword is used to represent the absence of a value. In Python, the equivalent is None. The Python version uses the "is" keyword to check if a node is None, while the C# version uses the "!=" operator to check if a node is not null.

4. Boolean Assignment: In C#, the EndOfWord property is set to true when a word is inserted. In Python, the equivalent property is endOfString, and it is also set to True when a word is inserted.

5. Main Function: In C#, the Main method is the entry point of the program. In Python, the equivalent is the main function, but it needs to be called explicitly in a "if __name__ == "__main__":" block.

6. Print/Console.WriteLine: In C#, Console.WriteLine is used to print to the console. In Python, the print function is used.

7. Method Calling: In Python, methods are called using dot notation on the object, similar to C#. However, Python does not require parentheses if no arguments are passed.

8. String Iteration: In Python, strings are iterable, so you can loop over them directly. In C#, you need to use an index to access each character.

# Java Differences

Both the C# and Java versions solve the problem in a similar way. They both create a Trie data structure with insert and search functionality. The Trie is implemented as a tree of nodes (TrieNode), where each node contains a map/dictionary of its children and a flag indicating whether it is the end of a word.

The main differences between the two versions are due to the differences between the C# and Java languages:

1. In C#, the Dictionary class is used to store the children of each TrieNode, while in Java, the HashMap class is used. These two classes provide similar functionality, but are part of different standard libraries (System.Collections.Generic in C# and java.util in Java).

2. In the C# version, the ContainsKey method is used to check if a character is already a child of the current node. In the Java version, the get method is used instead, which returns null if the character is not present.

3. In the C# version, the character at a specific index in a string is accessed directly using array-like syntax (word[i]). In the Java version, the charAt method is used instead.

4. The way of printing to the console is different in both languages. In C#, Console.WriteLine is used, while in Java, System.out.println is used.

5. The C# version uses the 'var' keyword for variable declaration, which infers the type from the right-hand side expression. Java does not have this feature, so the type must be explicitly declared.

6. The C# version uses properties (EndOfWord) while the Java version uses public fields (endOfWord). This is more of a design choice rather than a language feature difference.

7. The C# version uses a separate Program class with a static Main method as the entry point of the program, while the Java version includes the main method within the Trie class. This is again more of a design choice and convention in each language.
